            <p> Considered by many to be both an unstoppable force and an immovable object; Reinhardt is able to fly in
                head first at break neck speeds with his rocket powered armour.
                His armour also allows him to provide a large area of cover for allies with a wide energy shield
                equipped on his wrist.
            </p>
            <p>Reinhardt was one of the founding members of the Overwatch strike force showing great leadership and
                never failed to lift the spirits of his fellow teammates.</p>
            <p>In his earlier years Reinhardt was part of a special operations team called the Crusaders. These
                crusaders were as strong as they come and showed no fear in the face of battle. At its peak there were
                15 of these fearless super soldiers. But unfortunately over the years of hard fought battles, the
                numbers dwindled. when the war was all said and done, Reinhardt was the last known crusader left on this
                earth.</p>
